introduction: Recently I bought a new mouse called "Logitech G Pro Wireless" and it turned out to be 50 times better than my previous mouse called "Bloody A7". Today I'll tell you about this mouse. Buckle up!

# First emotions
## Well, when I got it I right away realised it was way lighter than Bloody A7, I felt as if I just thought I had to move my hand and it moved the mouse with no effort from me. That was crazy! Then I scrolled the mouse wheel, and it was so smooth and responsive. The movement was highly accurate and snappy. Over the next few weeks I was restlessly cleaning the mouse and the desk up with antiseptic napkins so that it was dry, because I liked it a lot.

# Charging
## After enjoying the mouse for a long time and cleaning it up very frequently I decided to make sure I had enough battery to keep doing that, so I was able to install the software and do it. The battery had gone down by a tremendously low percent, and I was nearly perplexed, for I was aware of my mouse being broken, because I suspected that it couldn't lose so little battery over that amount of time, but it actually did. You can literally use it for weeks and then charge it while eating your lunch, and then when you have eaten your lunch you'll see it fully charged.

# First pros I encountered
## Most of the pros I have encountered come from my first emotions, so I'd like to repeat again that it is truly responsive, snappy, light and smooth.

# First cons I encountered
## After using it for quite a long time I haven't noticed any cons at all. Actually no. That's what I would say if I knew that you definitely have a mousepad, but in my case I have no, so it is sometimes too sensitive to the table. Looking forward to getting one, by the way.
